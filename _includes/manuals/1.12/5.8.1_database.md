All Foreman instances in a cluster/group must point to the same database. This can be done during the initial installation (through flags or altering foreman_installer_answers.yaml) or by directly altering $app_root/config/database.yaml (usually a symlink to the real file) and pointing the correct lifecycle to your Foreman DB, then restarting Foreman.
