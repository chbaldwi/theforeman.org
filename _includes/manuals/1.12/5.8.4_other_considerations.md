There are other considerations when creating a cluster:
<ol><li>You might want to share a common hostname, which can be set during installation or by modifying your Apache config files.</li>
<li>You might want a custom cert to reflect the cluster's cname, and you'll want to make sure your Foreman-related infrastructure is [configured to use SSL](manuals/{{page.version}}/index.html#5.4SecuringCommunicationswithSSL).</li>
<li>You can use a central memcached instance instead of each Foreman instance's local cache. Foreman has a [plugin](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_memcache) you can use.</li></ol>
