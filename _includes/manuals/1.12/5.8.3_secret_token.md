The last file required to make a Foreman cluster work is {% highlight bash %}$app_root/tmp/secret_token.rb{% endhighlight %}. This file should contain a secret token that is modeled after {% highlight bash %}$app_root/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb{% endhighlight %}. {% highlight bash %}$app_root/tmp/secret_token.rb{% endhighlight %} is used by {% highlight bash %}$app_root/config/initializers/secret_token.rb{% endhighlight %} to sign cookies. Once you have created the new secret_token.rb, restart Foreman and clear Foreman's cache:
{% highlight bash %}
foreman-rake tmp:cache:clear
foreman-rake tmp:sessions:clear
{% endhighlight %}

Note: The file {% highlight bash %}$app_root/config/initializers/secret_token.rb{% endhighlight %} is uncommented, the logic behind this step rests on suggestions from IRC and testing. Without this change, the user may need to log in multiple times, may run in to "Invalid Authenticity Token"/CSRF issues, or it might just work for no clear reason.
