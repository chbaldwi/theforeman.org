The last file required to make a Foreman cluster work is `$app_root/tmp/secret_token.rb`. This file should contain a secret token that is modeled after `$app_root/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`. `$app_root/tmp/secret_token.rb` is used by `$app_root/config/initializers/secret_token.rb` to sign cookies. Once you have created the new secret_token.rb, restart Foreman and clear Foreman's cache:
{% highlight bash %}
foreman-rake tmp:cache:clear
foreman-rake tmp:sessions:clear
{% endhighlight %}

Note: Without this change, the user may need to log in multiple times or run in to "Invalid Authenticity Token"/CSRF issues.
